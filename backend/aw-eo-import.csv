It eliminates pain by inducing numbness in the nerves and by desensitizing the area. It is very effective in relieving the pain of headaches, migraines, toothaches, earaches, and muscle and joint pain, as well as pain due to sprains.This oil stimulates the circulation of the blood and lymph, thereby preventing the accumulation of uric acid in the joints and bringing warmth to various parts of the body. These two factors together help give relief from rheumatism, arthritis, and gout.Open wounds are prone to infections since bacteria, fungi, and other microbes have a very good chance of getting into the bloodstream through these wounds. Bacteria also reside in the urogenital tracts, colon, prostate, intestines, and kidneys and cause infections of the urethra and other sensitive body parts. The essential oil of Niaouli, thanks to its antiseptic properties, can inhibit bacterial growth in those areas and gives good protection against sepsis, tetanus, and infections of the other internal organs.","IDN","3301291100","0.0%","","Normal","https://media.aiku.io/hgQLLDnDJlR5csgyHu1EnnxQUmcryxAeNcIvxxRgNQw/bG9jYWw6Ly9tZWRpYS8xUC8wQy82MFIzMEMxRzY0VzMwQzFQLzcwYTdhNDBkLmpwZWc, https://media.aiku.io/6OQMcjFwdvpfbTlf48bUt_Wh326pfQEQwuzx4BmKYgU/bG9jYWw6Ly9tZWRpYS8xUS8wQy82MFIzMEMxRzY0VzMwQzFRLzUzMDA2YThkLmpwZWc, https://media.aiku.io/A-cmzdci6LlpWTCQvlTvOGLyyq1hb5ZtW6L5QgPdMi0/bG9jYWw6Ly9tZWRpYS8xUi8wQy82MFIzMEMxRzY0VzMwQzFSL2Q5MGE3NzRiLmpwZWc","2025-12-06 02:45:57+00","2025-12-06 02:45:57+00","","2025-09-11 06:08:02+00","109"
